            <h1>PREAMBLE</h1>
South Africa’s cultural diversity is a natural asset. The promotion of multilingualism, 
particularly the development of South Africa’s official languages is something which should be 
encouraged in schools. Before the birth of democracy indigenous languages had little status in 
the country and their growth was not encouraged by the government. Afrikaans and English 
took pride of place and most South Africans felt obliged to communicate in one of these. 
This discriminatory policy has affected the learners’ access to indigenous languages and has 
resulted in an adult population which is mostly unilingual. To redress this situation, it is 
imperative for learners to be given the opportunity and, importantly, to be encouraged to learn 
languages other than their own.
<h1>PRACTICABILITY</h1>
Studying in one’s home language is highly desirable. It is academically sound, and it gives 
learners the opportunity to connect with their roots and with their heritage. Unfortunately, with 
South Africa having eleven official languages, it is not possible for a school to offer learning 
and teaching in each of these and a compromise must be reached by all stake holders.
The Education Department employs one teacher to 35 learners. This limits the number of 
subjects a school can offer. After ensuring that all compulsory subjects are covered, there are 
not enough teachers available to offer more than one or two additional languages. Thus 
encouraging multilingualism presents a problem. But, working within these limits, schools 
should do all it can to foster languages via activities such as cultural events and afternoon 
classes.
Despite prolific international research there are still diverse views on the cognitive benefits 
of home language or multilingual schooling. Cost-effectiveness is another issue that needs to 
be addressed. The school must nevertheless, in the interests of national building, foster 
tolerance and respect for all languages.

<h1>THE RIGHTS AND DUTIES OF THE SCHOOL</h1>

In accordance with the South African Schools Act and the admissions policy of Valley View Primary School, the language of teaching and learning is English. The subject English is offered at Home Language Level. Valley View Primary School High School offers pupils both Afrikaans and isiZulu as 
second languages. Every effort is made to employ language teachers who have their teaching subject as a home language. 
Immigrant pupils are encouraged to study their own home language as an alternative to 
Afrikaans or isiZulu, if it is offered for examination by the Department of Education. These 
pupils attend lessons with private tutors who liaise regularly with the school. South Africans 
who speak one of the other official languages as a home language, may also take their home language as an additional language if they can arrange for a suitable teacher to prepare them. This language policy has been endorsed by all stakeholders, including the Governing Body. 
Eight periods are allocated to all languages in every 6-day cycle, Academic support, in all 
three languages, is given to any pupil who requires extra help and special enrichment classes are held to advance proficiency in the use of English. 
Although many of our learners have English as a second or even third language,
they have in the past all passed English at home language level and many have attained great 
success in Public Speaking and Debating competitions against established and successful 
English speaking schools.
All meetings in the school will be conducted in English. However, where a translator is 
required, the school and the parent can work together to arrange for the services of a 
translator.
All verbal feedback to parents regarding their children’s progress will be conducted in English. 
All correspondence will be through the medium of English namely, school brochures, bulletins 
on bulletin boards, timetables, letters, newspaper articles (except when the other approved 
languages – isiZulu and Afrikaans are being taught).</p>
